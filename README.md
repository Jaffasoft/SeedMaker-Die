Welcome to SeedMaker Die a Printable 100% Offline Way to Make Your Own Seed Phrase on Paper

It took me week going down the rabbit hole of learning all about how a seed words and i built a whole heap of online spreadsheets that i shared with the public and even used GROK3 to write a SeedMaker Kivy and code etc. At the end of the day i derived this simple but i think the best way for me anyway to know your seed is done properly where you can 100% verify and see that you rolled the die yourself you seen how it was done, you calculated the results you seen how it was all done on open black and white pen and peace of paper. 

SeedMaker Die
IMPORTANT: OUT OF ALL THE SPREADSHEETS IN MY GITHUB REPOSITORY OF SCRIPTS AND CODES AND KIVYS AND WAYS I HAVE MADE SEEDS, THIS PRINTABLE 100% OFFLINE SIMPLE PEACE OF PAPER IS THE ONLY WAY I SUGGEST YOU DO YOUR OWN REAL SEED!!!! THE SPREADSHEETS AND KIVY AND PYTHON SCRIPTS SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO LEARN DO NOT EVER USE THEM ONLINE TO MAKE YOUR OWN SEED PHRASE FOR ANY REAL WALLET OR DEVICE ETC. BE WARNED YOU CAN BE HACKED!!!


Know you are doing it safe and create and validate a 12 or 24 word BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase 100% offline with die and pencil to use in SeedSigner or other reputable Hardware Device.


This is an interesting exercise and life skill to have. Grab a coffee, grad a die and pencil. sit down with your printed peace of paper. See how a BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase is derived and validated with a checksum. You can refer to and look up each word from the wordlist online but do all your math offline and in the paper! You can do it all by hand on paper with a pencil and a calculator is handy but if you are good with math not essential (not your online phone or not even a phone with Bluetooth or WiFi turned off). 


SeedMaker-Die instructions and further instructions are on the printed page. 
1). Print A4 Template.
2). Follow the easy instructions.


Use SeedSigner for calculating the last word 12th or 24th (checksum) 100% OFFLINE and the SeedSigner built in functions to help you draw a QR code so it stays offline. SeedSigner is stateless so when you power the device off it loses all the information and seed(s). The only copies you have is on the QR code on paper OFFLINE and or stamped into steal or similar. 


Notes: It's all about doing this complete process 100% OFFLINE where no Malware or any other ways can hack the information from your online pc, laptop, tablet or phone etc and get your all important seed. Keep your seed offline ALWAYS! That is your task ongoing. To do this you really need to break out and buy a hardware device. SeedSigner is a very good and cheap option to get started but also all you really need going forward. 


I have no affiliation with SeedSigner i have just used the device and found it a low cost entry point diy minimal no frills device and project to built at home that works well.
